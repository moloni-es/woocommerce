= Documents are being issued without a taxpayer number=
By default, WooCommerce does not have a taxpayer field, so what you usually do is add a plugin to add the taxpayer to the customer.

These plugins create a custom_field associated with the customer's billing address, such as  `_billing_nif`.

Once you have a plugin for the contributor installed, just select in the settings of the Moloni plugin which  `custom_field` corresponds to the client's contributor.
