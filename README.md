## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there a paid version of the plugin?
No. The plugin was developed and is made available completely free.

### How much will I have to pay for support? 
Like the Moloni software, all support is completely free and provided entirely by our Moloni Customer Support team.

### I have questions or suggestions, who can I contact? 
For any doubts or suggestions you can contact us via email soporte@moloni.es.

### Documents are being issued without a taxpayer number
By default, WooCommerce does not have a taxpayer field, so what you usually do is add a plugin to add the taxpayer to the customer.

These plugins create a custom_field associated with the customer's billing address, such as  `_billing_nif`.

Once you have a plugin for the contributor installed, just select in the settings of the Moloni plugin which  `custom_field` corresponds to the client's contributor.


## Installation
This plugin can be installed via FTP or using the WordPress plugin installer.
